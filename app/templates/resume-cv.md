**Organizational Development:** Worked with a small group to define, roll out, and iterate the engineering career ladder. Draw on my personal collection of ~40 career ladders as well as personal experience creating multiple ladders in the past.

**Team Building and People Leadership:** Set the standard for continuous performance review process, hiring teams, and running teams. Consistently delievered "the most useful review I've ever received" to my reports.

**Cross-team, Cross-functional Problem Solving:** Drove, designed, collaborated, and executed multiple cross-team, cross-functional intiatives to address significant issues affecting the platform.

**Team and Technical Leadership:** Worked with dozens of people across the company to get input and feedback on a long-term direction, developed a detailed technical and organizational plan, synthesized it into key points for presenting to leadership, then reoriented planning (not just on my team) to this north star.

**Made Hard Calls for Quality:** Declared a "Code Yellow" for my team to stop product work to focus on a new test matrix that tests deployments across the dimensions: node version, framework version, and package manager. This allowed the company to deploy with confidence.

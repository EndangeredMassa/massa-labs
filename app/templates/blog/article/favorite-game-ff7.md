Guide to absorbing the Final Fantasy VII universe.

## The Impact

I was a big fan of Final Fantasy IV and VI as a kid. When Final Fantasy VII came out, I played it for so long the in game time maxed out at 99 hours.

After that, Final Fantasy VI was still my favorite. Over time, though, I encontered more people who loved VII. The Retro Gaming YouTube culture put out many a video essay on the original and related games. The more I eplored other people's love for VII, the more I loved it, too.

Having now played Remake and Rebirth, I've love the whole universe even more. This is how I want to share my love of it.

## The Journey

This guide takes you from nothing to immersed in this world. I tried to add as many options for absorbing each part as possible, including playthroughs and summaries where possible.

### Ignore

- **Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier**
    - This was a mobile game that didn't do much before it died.
- **Last Order: Final Fantasy VII**
    - This was an animation done retelling two scenes from the overall story.
    - It's not really considered canon anymore, but it also doesn't super matter anyway.

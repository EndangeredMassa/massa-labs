The perception of a team's performance can very by many things. There have been many discussions about Outcomes (higher-level effects) vs Outputs (lower-level, discrete results), where many argue that Outcomes are all that matter. I've long bristled at this notion, but couldn't articulate the full depth of why until now.

I see Team Performance in the following categories, ordered from (perceived) best operating teams to least:

1. Outcomes High
1. Outcomes Low, Outputs High
1. Outputs Low, Context Deep
1. Context Shallow


**Terms**

- **Outcomes:** higher-level impact on the company or customers
- **Outputs:** lower-level, discrete results
- **Context:** team dynamics, priorities, organizational weather
- **Organizational Weather:** higher-level changes in priorities, incentives, or resources that can't easily be influenced


## Team Performance Categories

### 1. Outcomes High

**Appearance:** The team is delivering obvious, high-level value to the company and/or customers on a good cadence.

**Team Assessment:** The team is perceived to be doing very well. Recognition comes at the leadership, management, and team member levels. Outputs could be low or high, but the outcomes mask that.

**Risks:** Team members could be succeptiable to burnout. The team could be building up technical debt or cruft. If the outputs are low, teh team could be in danger of falling down two categories to “3. Outputs Low, Context Deep”.

**Derisk:** Maintain what you are doing, as long as it's sustainable. Identify burnout risks and mitigate them. If the outputs are low, identify and resolve blockers to outputs (CI, CD, Technical Debt/Cruft, Code Review processes) and make work visible.


### 2. Outcomes Low, Outputs High

**Appearance:** There are no big deliverables, at least not often, but team metrics look good.

**Team Assessment:** The team is perceived to be doing some form of good, but depending on the team context, it could be better. Questions may be asked about why outcomes are low or what the team metrics look like. You may hear "Why hasn't this team been shipping?".

**Risks:** The team could be working on the wrong things or not focusing on MVP version. The company may not understand the team's work, leading to insufficient staff or resources.

**Derisk:** Revisit prioritization of work, focusing on impactful projects that have a vertical slice of value or milestones. For support teams, this catogory may be appropriate, but that narrative has to be communicated.


### 3. Outputs Low, Context Deep

**Appearance:** There are no big deliverables and the team metrics don't look great.

**Team Assessment:** The team is not perceived to be doing well. Context certainly matters, but something needs to change. Questions are asked about why outcomes are low, outputs are low, and what the context is that explains it.

**Risks:** The team's leadership could be changed.

**Derisk:** Break apart the context and dig in to understand. Change processes, prioritization, or even motivation on the team. Make work visible. Build momentum on Outcomes, then Outputs where possible.


### 4. Context Shallow

**Appearance:** When asked about why there are no big deliverables and the team metrics don't look great, can't clearly explain the context.

**Team Assessment:** The team is perceived to be doing very poorly. This is a dire position. Something big needs to change as soon as possible.

**Risks:** The team's leadership could be changed. The team's membership could be changed.

**Derisk:** Call emergency session to diagnose the problems. Consider big changes and make some of them. Monitor daily for signs of improvement, then communicate that progress to stakeholders.


## Key Insights

I see Outcomes as the ultimate goal, but you can only reliabily get there if you focus on Outputs first. I see Outputs as software engineering fundamentals. If those are good, you can often (but not always) make other small changes to achieve high Outcomes.

**When Outcomes are high, but Outputs are low:** You are in danger of falling down two levels to "3. Outputs Low, Context Deep", or worse.

**When Outcomes are low:** It's tempting to blame process, looking to add more or remove some.

**When Outputs are low:** It's tempting to scrutinize hours worked and tasks completed on a daily basis.

**Teams vs. Individual Contributors:** This article focuses on teams, but the same ideas are apply to team members. You may have to work harder to tell the narritive around your own performance, though.

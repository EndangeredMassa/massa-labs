I've tried different ways to consume political news more actively since 2015.

My goals when consuming news are:

1. on my own time, not continuously (e.g. in a social feed or via notifications)
2. from well sourced, ideally explicitly fact-checked sources
3. holding known biases in mind
4. with as much context as possible

The sources listed here help me accomplish those goals.


## Ground News

Ground News aggregates from many sources, highlights bias, highlights funding, and referenecs three independent fact checkers. I've been using it to dig deeper on stories I wouldn't normally see with their Blindspot feed.

I feel like I better understand other positions after using this news source..


## 404 Media

404 Media is a newer media organization founded by some industry veterans that wanted to be independent. They write about "hidden worlds", focused on technology. Their podcast discusses some of their recent stories, often adding some more detail.

This source exposes me to many things I wouldn't have found otherwise.

In the wake of the 2016 US Presidential Election, Matt Kiser turned their daily log of presendential news into this site and ultimately their full time job. Every post contains the top goings-on of presidential/national news with some context and links to news sources.

If you want a quick list of top stories for the day, this is a great source.

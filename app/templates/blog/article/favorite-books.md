Fantasy:
- Cradle: Progression fantasy with really great characters. Each book kinda feels like an action movie. I plowed through the entire series. It's an easier and more fun read.
- Cosmere: This is the collection of books and full series by Brandon Sanderson in a shared universe. To risk overhyping: It's a masterwork of art. The different worlds have different magic systems and cultures, but the underlying rules to how the magic works is consistent. Then, characters start crossing over to other worlds. Let me know if you want suggestions on a starting point. (edited) 
- [Legends and Lattes](https://libro.fm/search?q=Legends+%26+Lattes&searchby=series&sortby=series_asc): A cozy, low-stakes fantasy series about an adventurer who is kind of done with the whole adventuring thing. I never thought I'd be into this subgenre, but I loved the two books in this series so far. The third is coming in November. This was written by Travis Baldree, who is the audiobook narrator for Cradle.
* [The Elder Empire](https://www.willwight.com/the-elder-empire.html): is in the same universe as Cradle, but other than the occasional nod, you don't need to care about that. It's 2 parallel trilogies where book 1 of each takes place at the same time and each trilogy has its own main character. The magic system is based on consistent human intent over time imbuing items with magical properties, which is neat. There are also Lovecraftian entities around the world, which I'm not usually into, but it's done so well here. The characters and story are quite enjoyable.
* [Spells, Swords, & Stealth](https://www.audible.com/series/Spells-Swords-Stealth-Audiobooks/B018WJ5YUG) (series): In the real world, people play this TTRPG, but it turns out there's a magical artifact that makes those sessions really happen in a fantasy world. This book follows some real world TTRPG players (and their characters) and some "NPC" characters from the fantasy world. The NPC characters become their own party of adventurers with nontraditional race/class combinations. It's just a fun read.
* [Gentleman Bastards](https://www.audible.com/series/Gentleman-Bastard-Sequence-Audiobooks/B006K1SORE) (series): A group of street kids grow up to be a confidence gang, but with hearts. The characters are dripping with personality and the story is compelling. This is a low-magic fantasy world, but magic does come into play. 
* [Magic 2.0](https://www.audible.com/series/Magic-20-Audiobooks/B00MQ2WZIK) (series): In the real world, a kid finds a mysterious file on a computer network. After poking around, they realize this file is infiinitely large, constantly changing, and seems to represent the state of the universe. Writing to this file at specific locations changes the real world. They immediately get attention for doing something stupid and escape to medieval England. This series has some great characters and interesting stories that can be silly (in a fun way).

Sci-fi:
* Neal Stephenson: I've not read all of their work, but these books had a big impact on me. I did also read [Snow Crash](https://www.audible.com/pd/Snow-Crash-Audiobook/B002UUKWCY), which was neat back in the day, but ages pretty poorly.
    * [Diamond Age](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Diamond-Age-Audiobook/B002UZJR4S): A fun story about a kid who ended up with a stolen Digital Aristotle.
    * [Anathem](https://www.audible.com/pd/Anathem-Audiobook/B086WNG3RK): A wild ride of a culture that treats math/learning like a religion, then -stuff- happens. This is one of those books that is hard to really talk about. You leave it feeling like you hit your head really hard, in a good way.
    * [Seveneves](https://www.audible.com/pd/Seveneves-Audiobook/B00WNBF0RM): Similar to Anathem in how this has an impact on the reader. It's the story of the current world that has to deal with something blowing up the moon, which has catastrophic consequences on the Earth. 
* Star Wars
    * https://www.audible.com/pd/Star-Wars-Bloodline-New-Republic-Audiobook/B01CRMO9BE

Non-fiction:
* [Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](https://www.audible.com/pd/Peak-Audiobook/B01F4A9EFW): The point of this book is that talent is overrated and prodigies don't come from nowhere--you can master almost any skill with the right approach and a time commitment. It takes a while to drive home these points, but this book really pulled that truth into relief for me.

Histories
* [Stay Awhile and Listen](https://www.audible.com/series/Stay-Awhile-and-Listen-Audiobooks/B08TRD5129) (series): There are two books so far that each cover one of Diablo and Diablo II's development. I don't hero worship the people or companies involved, but I find histories like these interesting.
* [Dungeon Hacks: How NetHack, Angband, and Other Roguelikes Changed the Course of Video Games](https://www.audible.com/pd/Dungeon-Hacks-Audiobook/B016NE6Q4K): A neat walk through where the original Rogue-likes came from.

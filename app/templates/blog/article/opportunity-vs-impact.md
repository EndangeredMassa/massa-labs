At many places I've worked, and in many of the career ladders I've studied from my collection of over 40, "impact" is a common way employees are judged. It is sometimes used to control who can get promotions to specific levels. Other times it's an entire performance critera in a performance review.

- "lead a large, successful project"
- "have team / engineering-wide / business-wide level impact"

Even if it's not explicit, "impact" will often be rewarded.

Wanting impact is fine and all, but being able to *have* impact can depend a lot on opportunity. That opportunity isn't always going to be provided to you.

The general guidance I have for team members that want to focus on their impact is:

> Work with [your manager, tech lead, or director] to find or make opportunities to have [level of impact].

In this article, I want to share how team members can go about doing that.


## Finding Opportunities

Opportunity can often be found. At a large enough company, user base, or code base, you can find a problem that no one is paying attention to.

**Customer Issues:** Read through old customer issues, looking for common problems.

**Collaboration Issues:** Read through questions from other teams for common issues. Talk to the related business functions, e.g, Security, Legal, Data, DevRel, Docs, Pricing about their pain points working with your team or Engineering.

**Incidents:** Audit a history of incidents.

**CI / CD:** CI / CD issues

**Roadmap:** look ahead at the team’s roadmap for impactful projects and lobby to lead that project

**Competition:** look at the industry or competitors to find gaps in Vercel’s products

Sometimes the opportunity you find will have obvious value and priority to decision makers. If not, you'll have to make the opportunity


## Making Opportunities

How to make opportunity for a given project idea.

**Write an RFC:**

**Create a Demo:**

**Resolve Unknowns:**

- talk to the related engineering teams
- talk to the related business functions, e.g, Security, Legal, Data, DevRel, Docs, Pricing
- lobby your manager, tech lead, product manager, and/or director



## Driving Opportunities to Completion

When an opportunity is being worked on that can have the desired level of impact, such as a project, how well the team member managed external forces can affect their impact.

Forces
- Organizational Weather
- Project Clarity


## Responsibility of Individual vs. Manager

Each advancement level should probably have a different level of responsibility for how they find opportuniuties, make opportunities, or manage external forces.

**Who is responsible for pushing projects through external forces (requirements change, appetite change, potential project cancellation)?**

- early career: more manager than team member
- later career: balance between manager and team member
- master level: mostly team member

Every so often, I like to survey the JavaScript test runner space to see what's out there. This time, I was pushed to do so by continuing to hit bugs and limitations of Jest.

I worked with my team at Vercel to flesh out this comparison.

Spoiler: `vitest` wins.


## Context

Recent Jest issues 've Iencountered:

- [failing beforeAll() causes even passing tests in the scope to fail #6695](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/6695)
- [Jest should fail fast and exit early (change request for --bail) #6527](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/6527)
- [Jest globals differ from Node globals #2549](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/2549)

Test runner libraries under consideration:

- `jest` ([docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started))
- `vitest` ([docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/features.html))
- `mocha` ([docs](https://mochajs.org/))
- `node-tap` ([docs](https://node-tap.org/))
- `node:test`Â ([docs](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html))


## Requirements and Nice to Haves

Requirements:

- maturity: battle-tested, active project
- parallelization: able to run individual tests (not only entire files) in parallel with proper concurrency limits and strategies for preventing test pollution
- sharding: grouping tests into chunks that can be run separately, across many files
- JS modules / ESM: native support for ecmascript modules
  TypeScript: native support for TypeScript
- hook failure: skips all tests in context when `before`/`beforeAll` fails
- hooks order: execute in proper (lexical) order
- no globals required
- no globals overridden

Nice to haves:

- low startup time: &lt;1sec OK, &lt;200ms awesome
- snapshots: saving state to disk for comparison in future runs
- mocking imports: easily replacing imported module with a test module
- non-trivial assertions: assertion library that produces good error messages for many cases
- bail / fail-fast option: option to fail entire suite on first failure
- watch mode
- line coverage: not very important to me, but useful for others


## Comparison

Feature Matrix:

| ----- *Nice to Have* ----- | | | | | |
| **low startup time** | ~341 ms | ~941 ms | ~290 ms | ~794 ms | ~193 ms |
| **snapshots** | Y | Y | N | Y | N |

Key:

- `Y`: yes, this feature exists and is useful
- `Y*`: yes, this feature exists, but may require a plugin or non-trivial config
- `N`: no, this feature does not exist
- `N*`: no, this feature does not exist, but the docs/community say it does
- `~`: ish, this feature exists, but may be incomplete or immature


## Decision

[`vitest`](https://vitest.dev)!

The only tool that meets almost every requirement and nice-to-have is `vitest`. That's my new default decision.

If you notice anything wrong in this chart, please let me know!

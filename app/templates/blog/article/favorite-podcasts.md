- [Shardcast](): Covers all things Brandon Sanderson, mostly the Cosmere books. Excellent way to engage further with the world. It's especially helpful in processing the information dense books. 
- [MTG Drive to Work](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/drive-work-podcast-archive-2013-08-09-0): Mark Rosewater's (lead designer of Magic) podcast about all things Magic, but mostly history and behind-the-scenes stuff. Very neat if you want to learn more about the game.
- [citation needed](https://www.citationneeded.news/):  Molly White's crypto criticism podcast. Very detailed coverage of what's going on in that world.
- [Tech Won't Save Us](https://www.techwontsave.us/): Paris Marx interview experts across technical fields about what's going wrong. Heavy on the criticism.
- [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/): An independent news organization that's been doing great reporting on how tech is being used to subvert human rights. They're the best in that game, it seems.

 But my favorite is [If Books Could Kill](https://www.ifbookspod.com/). Each episode, one of the two hosts (they trade off) has done research on an "airport" book, its author, reception, and legacy. They critique the books substance and claims, going deep on other research or simply taking a step back and thinking through those claims' logical conclusions. They take a critical thinking and research approach to understanding these books that I deeply appreciate.

This year, I played several games that became some of my favorite games of all time. I was pretty surprised by that. I highly recommend my favorites of this year.


## My Favorites of 2023

- **Cyberpunk 2077 (Phantom Liberty)**
    - Now that the bugs are (mostly) worked out, this is the best FPS open world game out there. The Phantom Liberty DLC has an better-paced, even more compelling story.
- **Baldur's Gate 3**
    - It's the best way to play D&D in a video game.
- **Zelda Breath of the Wild** (beat) AND **Tears of the Kingdom** (beat)
    - I played these basically back to back this year. Both are great, I enjoyed them a great deal, but I still don't like the weapon breaking/crafting system.
- **Spider-Man 2** (beat)
    - This is the new best super hero game of all time. Traversal through the city is amazing, the story is great, and combat is excellent.


## Games Played in 2023

### Single-Player Games

- **Crisis Core Final Fantasy 7 Reunion** (beat)
    - I never played the original. This game isn't amazing on console--it's very clearly a mobile-device game, but it's still fun. I really wanted to consume the story and see what upgrades they made in this version. If you are into the FF7 universe, this is worth it.    
- **Final Fantasy XVI**
    - The boss fights are very pretty, but the story and setting were very boring to me. The definition of a Final Fantasy game has long be fuzzy, but this isn't even a Final Fantasy game to me.
- **No Man's Sky**
    - The exploration is great for a time, but gets old quickly. I gave this a real go waiting for Cyberpunk fixes and DLC to release. It just doesn't grab me.
- **Octopath Traveler 2**
    - The battle system is really neat. The character stories are mostly very interesting. The graphics are just incredible. This is worth trying for anyone who enjoys RPGs.
- **Sea of Stars**
    - This game is wonderful, I'm just not very far into it yet. I very much want to get back to this and the other RPGs I only barely started like Chained Echoes and Octopath Traveler 2.
- **Super Mario Bro's Wonder** (current, plan to beat)
    - Strong 2D mario with good flavor. It feels like a Super Mario World sequel.
- **Super Mario RPG** (current, plan to beat)
    - Great to have this on a modern platform. The changes feel nice, but it's very faithful to the original. Very weird that Land's End alt exit is still confusing as hell to find.
- **Vampire Survivors** (consider it "beat", but didn't unlock everything)
    - It's fun, but I'm basically done with it.
- **Xenoblade Chronicles** (Definitive Edition) (current, plan to beat)
    - The story is really neat, the combat system feels kinda like a bad MMO, but I still want to stick it through to get to the other games in the series. The character conversations mechanic made it too hard to unlock, which meant I unlocked almost none of them. That made it harder to like this game more.
- **Yakuza Like a Dragon**
    - Hilarious RPG based in the real world (plus imagination). I liked it, and would like to see more of the story, but the progress is soooo slow. I had to drop it.


### Multiplayer Games

- **Apex Legends**
    - The core gameplay is awesome, but it seems like they only people who still play this are all really good. I can't do well in this game anymore.
- **Marvel Snap**
    - I've not been grabbed this hard by a quick card game since Hearthstone. The strategy of this game is higher than it appears. It's so good.
- **MTG Arena**
    - I still love trying out each new set. If you do well enough in events, you can more/less go infinite (not pay).
- **The Finals**
    - Finally another multiplayer shooter that plays well and isn't more/less just deathmatch. Assalting vaults, guarding deposits, using the fun abilities and utility items brings this together to a strong base. I hope they add more abilities, classes, and even a mode or two in the future.
- **Endless Dungeon**
    - Fun tower defense ish game that is great to play multiplayer, but you basically have to have a 3-player squad go in with good coordination to get the most out of this game. I think that's it's biggest problem.

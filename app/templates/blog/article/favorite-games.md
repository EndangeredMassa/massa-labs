I don't like to rank games. Instead, this is a collection of my favorite games grouped into categories that make sense to me.


## Final Fantasy VII

- ff7
- ff7 remake
- ff7 rebirth





## World of Warcraft



## Multi-player Games

- Super Monday Night Combat (2012 - 2014)
- The Cycle (2019 - 2022)
- Rumbleverse (2022 - 2023)
- **Apex Legends** (2019 - 2023)
    - The core gameplay is awesome, but it seems like they only people who still play this are all amazing. I can't do well in this game anymore.


## Digital Card Games

- **Hearthstone** (2014 - 2017)
    - 
- **Marvel Snap** (2022 - 2024)
    - I've not been grabbed this hard by a quick card game since Hearthstone. The strategy of this game is higher than it appears. It's so good.
- **MTG Arena** (2019 - current)
    - I still love trying out each new set. If you do well enough in events, you can more/less go infinite (not pay).



## Single-player Games

- Cyberpunk 2077 (Phantom Liberty)
- Zelda Tears of the Kingdom
- Baldur's Gate 3



*Super Mario RPG*


- *Astro Bot:* 
- *FF6:* 
- ff4
- ff9
